The purpose of the project entitled as “E-LEARNING WEBSITE SYSTEM” is to provide a
better and effective way to help students to get approved learning materials and information.
Users of the system can upload notes and videos of lectures into the site. These videos can be
viewed by all registered users of the system. Moreover, PowerPoint presentations on all topics
can be uploaded in to the system. Traditionally a lecturer had the burden of following up on each
student and ensuring that they had the correct reading materials. The lecturer shall be able to
access the system through the admin page and he/she can the approve the studying materials that
have been sent by the different users. This project will help student to study while incurring low
cost. This system It cannot replace teachers and lecturers, but alongside existing methods it can
enhance the quality and reach of their teaching, and reduce the time spent on administration. It
can enable every learner to achieve his or her potential, and help to build an educational
workforce empowered to change. It makes possible a truly ambitious education system for a
future learning society.
